            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Elon Reeve Musk FRS (born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor. He is the founder, CEO, and chief engineer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. With an estimated net worth of around $238 billion as of September 26, 2022,Musk is the wealthiest person in the world according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes' real-time billionaires list.<br>

                Musk was born and grew up in Pretoria, South Africa,. He attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University (Ontario) and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided to instead pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother, Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded the online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.<br>
                
                In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, and is its CEO and chief engineer. In 2004, he was an early investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, eventually assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company promoting friendly artificial intelligence (AI). In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and he founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system and is the president of the Musk Foundation, which donates to scientific research and education.<br>
                
                Musk has been criticized for making unscientific and controversial statements, such as spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and promoting contentious perspectives regarding politics and various technologies, especially on Twitter. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla, which the SEC characterized as false and misleading. He settled with the SEC but did not admit guilt, and he temporarily stepped down from his Tesla chairmanship. In 2019, he won a defamation case brought against him by a British caver who had advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue. In 2022, Musk agreed to purchase Twitter for $44 billion but later submitted a termination letter of the deal, leading to lawsuits between both parties. However, Musk later decided to move forward with the purchase.</p>

            <h1>Early Life</h1>
            <hr width="90%">
            <h2>Childhood and family</h2>
            <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, one of the capital cities of South Africa, and was baptized into an Anglican church.Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada and raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika. Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, (born 1972) and a younger sister, Tosca, (born 1974).<br>

                Musk's family was wealthy during his youth. His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, with his children reportedly sharing their father's dislike of apartheid. His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to Africa and Australia. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father. Musk later regretted his decision because he has become estranged from his father. He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.<br>
                
                In his biography, Ashlee Vance described Musk as an awkward and introverted child. When Musk was 10, he developed an interest in computing and video games, so he brought a Commodore VIC-20[vague] and taught himself programming from a user manual. At age 12, he sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.</p>
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School and graduated from Pretoria Boys High School. Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way. While waiting for the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African Defence Force.

                    Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill. In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School in 1995.[clarification needed]
                    
                    In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at the energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games. In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program in materials science at Stanford University. However, Musk decided to join the Internet boom instead and applied for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.</p>

                <hr width="90%">
                <h2>Zip2</h2>
                <p>n 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Zip2. In Ashlee Vance's biography of Elon Musk, it is claimed that the Musks' father, Errol Musk, provided them with US$28,000 during this time, but Elon Musk later denied this, claiming that his father invested in a later round of funding. The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers. They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto, with Musk coding the website in every night.Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[unreliable source?] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch; however, Musk's attempts to become CEO himself were thwarted.Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999, and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.</p>
                <h2>X.com and PayPal</h2>
                <p>Later in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.[53] X.com was one of the first federally insured online banks and over 200,000 customers joined after its initial months of operation.[54] Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[55]

                    In 2000, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition[46][55][56] as Confinity's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[57] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees and Peter Thiel, Confinity's founder, to resign.[58] In addition to compounding technological issues and a lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[59][b] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money transfer service and renamed as PayPal in 2001.[61][62]
                    
                    The next year, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million.[63][64] More than one and a half decades later, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal in 2017 because of his personal sentimental value.</p>
                    <h2>SpaceX</h2>
                    <p>In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[67] In October the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[68] and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[68] With $100 million of his early fortune,[69] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.<br>

                        SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[72] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator (and former SpaceX consultant[73]) Mike Griffin later that year.[74][75] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to bankrupt,[72] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[76] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[77] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, a first for a private enterprise.[78] Musk credited the NASA award, one of the last actions by Mike Griffin as NASA Administrator, for saving the company.<br>

                        Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on an inland platform.[80] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[81] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[82][83] Since 2019,[84] SpaceX is developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and Heavy.[85] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.
                        
                        SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide satellite Internet access,[87] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[88] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.[89][c] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat for spacecraft.[92][93][94] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink systems to Ukraine to provide internet access and communication,[95] an action praised by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[96][97] However, he refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself "a free speech absolutist."</p>
                        <h2>Tesla</h2>
                        <p>Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[100] Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[101] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[102] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.<br>

                            Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[104][page needed][105] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[106] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[107][108] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[109] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to "Technoking" while retaining his position as CEO.[110]</p>
                            <h2>SEC lawsuit</h2>
                            <p>In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet claiming funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[129][d] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[129][133][134] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[135] Musk has stated in interviews he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[136][137] In April 2022, the shareholder who sued Musk over the tweet along with several Tesla shareholders said that a federal judge had ruled that the tweet was false, although the ruling in question has not been unsealed.</p>
                            <h2>SolarCity and Tesla Energy</h2>
                            <p>Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[145] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[146] In 2014 Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[147] Construction on the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.</p>
                            <h2>Neuralink</h2>
                            <p>In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company with an investment of $100 million.[156][157] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain to facilitate its merging with machines. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[157][158] The company also hopes to develop devices that treat neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries<br>

                                In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[156] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as "a Fitbit in your skull" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[160][161][162] with MIT Technology Review describing them as "highly speculative" and "neuroscience theater".[160] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.</p>
                                <h2>The Boring Company</h2>
                                <p>In 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels.[167] Musk revealed plans for specialized high occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour, circumventing above-ground traffic in major cities.[168] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices as it required no permits.[169] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model X's and was reported to be a rough ride and travel at suboptimal speeds.</p>
